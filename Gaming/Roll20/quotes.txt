Another industrial ugly morning
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
Big wheels keep on turnin', Carry me home to see my kin
Check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
English, motherfucker, do you speak it?
Got no human grace, you're eyes without a face
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again
I'll say anything you want to h noear
I'm gonna run this nothing town
I've got a little black book with my poems in
In the back room she was everybody's darling
Is Lump fast asleep or rocking out with the band?
It was long ago and it was far away and it was so much better that it is today
Mista Dobalina, Mista Bob Dobalina
Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face.
Sittin' here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
Slipping and a-sliding all along the waterfall with you
The only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
There are many here among us who feel life is but a joke
They call it a Royale with Cheese
We always hang in the Buffalo Stance
Well, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers "Baby, it's okay"
Mama put my guns in the ground, I can't shoot them anymore
