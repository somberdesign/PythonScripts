=== Create a Movie Sales List ===

1. Download as CSV any Sales sheets that have changed. Save them in dir Csv_Sales. Change the filename to match the format of the others.

2. Put a current copy of 'Movie List.txt' in dir Input.

3. Execute ReadSalesCsv.py. This reads data from the csvs and puts it into \Output\SalesData.py.

4. Execute ModifyMovieList.py. This create MovieList_Sales.html, MovieList_Sales.txt and MovieList_Unmatched.txt in dir \Output.
